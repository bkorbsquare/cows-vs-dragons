## Description

Welcome to "cows-vs-dragons", a command-line program written in C. Here's what you can expect:

- **Game Concept:** This code showcases a compelling combat system that includes user interaction, specifically a dexterity challenge.
- **Development Tools:** I coded this project in C using Harvard's CS50-specific version of VS Code for the Web.
- **Inspirations:** The game draws inspiration from Cowsay, Dungeons & Dragons, Magic the Gathering, and Pokemon.
- **Future Enhancements:** I would like to expand the story to include additional heroes, items, and villains. I will also add features like stats permanently buffing after successful battles and a menu to select items, heroes, and more.

## Dependencies

This C program relies on the following standard C libraries:

- `stdio.h`: Standard Input/Output library.
- `stdlib.h`: Standard Library.
- `time.h`: Time-related functions.
- `termios.h`: Terminal I/O functions.
- `unistd.h`: Symbolic constants and types.
- `fcntl.h`: File control options.
- `sys/select.h`: Synchronous I/O multiplexing.
- `sys/time.h`: Time-related functions.

## Installation

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the list of files, click 'Code'.
3. Click 'Open with GitHub Desktop' to clone and open the repository.
4. Follow the prompts in GitHub Desktop to complete the clone.
5. Open the code in your code editor.
6. Open your terminal and compile the code (for instance, using gcc: `gcc my_program.c -o my_program`).
7. Run the program with `./my_program` to start the application.
8. If your system doesn't have the required libraries, install them using your system's package manager.

## Usage

Use this project as a reference when building command-line programs. It's a great example of a C-based command-line game with user interaction.
