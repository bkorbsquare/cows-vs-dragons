## Description

- This code displays a command-line program using C.
- I wanted to create a game that was interesting, fun, and had a compelling combat system that included user interaction (in this case a dexterity challenge).
- I coded in C using Harvard's CS50-specific version of VS Code for the Web.
- I was inspired by Cowsay, Dungeons & Dragons, Magic the Gathering, and Pokemon.
- Given more time I would expand the story to include additional heroes, items, and villians. I would add features like stats permanently buffing after successful battles, and a menu to select items/heroes/etc.

## Dependencies

This C program relies on the following standard C libraries:
- `stdio.h`: Standard Input/Output library.
- `stdlib.h`: Standard Library.
- `time.h`: Time-related functions.
- `termios.h`: Terminal I/O functions.
- `unistd.h`: Symbolic constants and types.
- `fcntl.h`: File control options.
- `sys/select.h`: Synchronous I/O multiplexing.
- `sys/time.h`: Time-related functions.

## Installation

On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. Above the list of files, click 'Code'. Click 'Open with GitHub Desktop' to clone and open the repository. Follow the prompts in GitHub Desktop to complete the clone. Open the code in your code editor. Open your terminal and compile the code (for instance I use gcc so 'gcc my_program.c -o my_program'). Run './my_program' to start the application. If your system doesn't already have the above libraries, you can install them using your system's package manager.

## Usage

Use this project as a reference when building command-line programs.
